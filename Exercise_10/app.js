If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.*/
//program 1
// Program to print a famous quote by Albert Einstein

//program 2
// Program to store a person's name with whitespace and then strip the whitespace
let personName = "\t\n John Doe \n\t";

// Strip whitespace and print the name
